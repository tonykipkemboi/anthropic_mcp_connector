    "We're now ready fetch the data but before that we need to create a function that will use Claude's MCP connector feature to take our prompts, connect to BrightData MCP and get us the data we need for analysis later. I used the code found [here](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp-connector) if you want to learn more about how this works.\n",
    "\n",
    "tl;dr - We're connecting to the remote streamable-http MCP server using the Messages API without using a separate MCP client. You could call this a client. This feature is still in beta so you have to add the header: `\"anthropic-beta\": \"mcp-client-2025-04-04\"`\n",
